Stable Merchant excerpt:

Growth Merchant excerpt:
Scale-linked deviations observed; consistency with growth-phase transaction behavior. Recurrent pattern; observed multiple times within the current day (Recurrence: 4693). Typically associated with early-stage shifts in transaction quality and risk profile. Velocity spikes represent deviation from hourly expectation. Geographic entropy indicates shift in traffic distribution.

Messy Merchant excerpt:
Multi-vector risk signals observed in already volatile transaction stream. Recurrent pattern; observed multiple times within the current day (Recurrence: 5168). Typically associated with early-stage shifts in transaction quality and risk profile. Velocity spikes represent deviation from hourly expectation. Geographic entropy indicates shift in traffic distribution.

--- GATE E: Historical Memory (Day 9 vs Day 3) ---
Day 3 Baseline (Growth Merchant):
Scale-linked deviations observed; consistency with growth-phase transaction behavior. Recurrent pattern; observed multiple times within the current day (Recurrence: 882). Typically associated with early-stage shifts in transaction quality and risk profile. Velocity spikes represent deviation from hourly expectation. Geographic entropy indicates shift in traffic distribution.
Day 9 Recurrence Record (Growth Merchant):
Scale-linked deviations observed; consistency with growth-phase transaction behavior. Recurrent pattern; observed multiple times within the current day (Recurrence: 12611). Typically associated with early-stage shifts in transaction quality and risk profile. Velocity spikes represent deviation from hourly expectation. Geographic entropy indicates shift in traffic distribution.
