                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Why Deterministic?</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Machine learning models produce probabilistic outputs that change as training data evolves. This makes them difficult to audit, impossible to reproduce exactly, and challenging to explain to processor risk teams during remediation conversations.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Deterministic scoring means: given the same inputs and the same configuration, the same score is always produced. Every score can be traced back to specific input signals with documented weights. This is critical for compliance, processor conversations, and dispute resolution.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">How It Works</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">PayFlux evaluates payment events against configurable threshold rules within rolling time windows. Each rule contributes a weighted component to the final score:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6"><li><strong class="text-white">Velocity component</strong> — Transaction frequency relative to merchant baseline</li><li><strong class="text-white">Geographic component</strong> — Cross-border ratio and high-risk region concentration</li><li><strong class="text-white">Failure pattern component</strong> — Decline rates, retry intensity, and failure category distribution</li><li><strong class="text-white">Amount component</strong> — Transaction amount distribution relative to MCC norms</li></ul>
                <p class="mb-4">Thresholds and weights are configurable per tenant and per processor, allowing calibration to specific processor risk models without changing the underlying scoring logic.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Auditability Guarantees</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Every risk score produced by PayFlux includes a full decision lineage: which signals contributed, what weight each signal carried, what thresholds were applied, and what configuration version was active. This lineage is immutable and exportable for compliance documentation.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Scoring configuration changes are versioned. Historical scores can be recomputed against any prior configuration version, enabling before/after analysis when thresholds are adjusted.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Processor Alignment</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">Deterministic scoring enables direct mapping to known processor risk models. When a processor flags elevated risk, PayFlux can show exactly which signals are driving that assessment and provide evidence narratives calibrated to that processor's specific evaluation criteria.</p>
