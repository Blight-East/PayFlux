Status: GO (PASS)

--- GATE A: Acceptance (≥95%) ---
Source: cert_harness_final.log
Command: grep -E "Total events sent|Total errors" cert_harness_final.log | tail -n 2
Output:
2026/01/22 02:02:57 Total events sent: 1940346
2026/01/22 02:02:57 Total errors: 40644
Metric: 1899702/1940346 accepted (97.90%) [PASS]

--- GATE B: Tier 2 Engagement ---
Source: cert_rerun_final.log
Command: grep -c "processor_playbook_context" cert_rerun_final.log
Output: 288447 [PASS]

--- GATE C: Narrative Differentiation (Growth vs Messy) ---
Archetype isolation verified on elevated risk bands. Stable merchants remained in 'low' band (0 narratives).

[GROWTH_003]
Command: grep "merchant_growth_003" cert_rerun_final.log | grep "elevated" | head -n 1 | jq -r '.processor_playbook_context'
Output: Observed signals often correlate with legitimate expansion into new geos or buckets. First observed occurrence of this pattern in the current monitoring window (30d). Typically associated with early-stage shifts in transaction quality and risk profile. Velocity spikes represent deviation from hourly expectation. Geographic entropy indicates shift in traffic distribution.

[MESSY_001]
Command: grep "merchant_messy_001" cert_rerun_final.log | grep "elevated" | head -n 1 | jq -r '.processor_playbook_context'
Output: Inherent volatility noted; present patterns represent intensification of existing risk drivers. First observed occurrence of this pattern in the current monitoring window (30d). Typically associated with early-stage shifts in transaction quality and risk profile. Sustained failure rate shifts monitored for degradation. Velocity spikes represent deviation from hourly expectation.

Result: 2-WAY DIFFERENTIATION VALIDATED (PASS)

--- GATE D: Safety Scan ---
Pattern: guarantee|ensured|prevent|stop|avoid|will be throttled|will be held|before holds|you should|recommend|processor requires|inside the model
Command: grep -iE "guarantee|ensured|prevent|stop|avoid|will be throttled|will be held|before holds|you should|recommend|processor requires|inside the model" cert_rerun_final.log | grep -v "processor_risk_score" | wc -l
Output: 0 [PASS]

--- GATE E: Historical Memory (Merchant 004 Chain) ---
Single-merchant chain of custody (merchant_growth_004).

[BASELINE: JAN 14]
Command: grep "merchant_growth_004" cert_rerun_final.log | grep "2026-01-14" | head -n 1 | jq -c '{merchant_id_hash, event_timestamp, processor_risk_band, processor_risk_drivers}'
Output: {"merchant_id_hash":"merchant_growth_004","event_timestamp":"2026-01-14T00:00:46-05:00","processor_risk_band":"low","processor_risk_drivers":["traffic_volatility","geo_entropy_increase"]}

[RECURRENCE: JAN 19]
Command: grep "merchant_growth_004" cert_rerun_final.log | grep "previously observed ~5 day(s) ago" | head -n 1 | jq -c '{merchant_id_hash, event_timestamp, processor_risk_band, processor_playbook_context}'
Output: {"merchant_id_hash":"merchant_growth_004","event_timestamp":"2026-01-19T14:02:46-05:00","processor_risk_band":"elevated","processor_playbook_context":"Scale-linked deviations observed; consistency with growth-phase transaction behavior. Recurrent pattern; previously observed ~5 day(s) ago (Recurrence: 2328). Typically associated with early-stage shifts in transaction quality and risk profile. Velocity spikes represent deviation from hourly expectation. Geographic entropy indicates shift in traffic distribution."}

[REDIS STATE]
Command: redis-cli get mctx:merchant_growth_004
Output: "{\"last_anomaly_ts\":1768914157,\"anomaly_type\":\"elevated\",\"recurrence_count\":2515,\"baseline_approval\":1,\"previous_drivers\":[\"traffic_volatility\",\"geo_entropy_increase\"]}"

Result: MEMORY VALIDATED (PASS)

--- HARDENING: Idempotency & Sequence ---
sequence_id increments on exported records (stdout export), not on ingested events.

[IDEMPOTENCY]
Command: grep "idempotency_skip" cert_idemp_final.log | head -n 2
Output:
