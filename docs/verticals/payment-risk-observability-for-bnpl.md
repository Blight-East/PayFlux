# BNPL Providers

## Definition
BNPL Risk Observability monitors the intersection of **Credit Risk** (Consumer Default) and **Payment Risk** (Merchant Disputes). BNPL providers pay the merchant upfront but collect from the consumer over time, creating a massive "Float" and specialized liability.

## Why it matters
Double Jeopardy. A consumer can default on the loan (Credit Loss) OR dispute the transaction (Payment Loss). Sometimes they do both. Additionally, the BNPL provider relies on *their own* processor to collect repayments; if that processor blocks them, the entire lending machine stops.

## Signals to monitor
- **Repayment Success**: The % of installment collections that succeed.
- **Merchant Dispute Rate**: Identify merchants whose goods are frequently returned/disputed by borrowers.
- **Settlement Float**: The total capital deployed vs capital collected.
- **Vintage Delinquency**: Defaults relative to loan origination month.

## Breakdown modes
- **Stacked Risk**: A merchant shipping bad goods + A consumer refusing to pay = BNPL provider stuck in the middle.
- **Processor Freeze**: The upstream acquirer freezing the BNPL provider's ability to pull funds from consumers due to high return rates.
- **Friendly Fraud**: Consumers claiming "Unauthorized" on the loan repayment charges.

## Where observability fits
- **Lifecycle Tracking**: Linking the Merchant Transaction -> Loan -> 4x Installment Payments into one view.
- **Merchant Scoring**: Rating merchants based on the *performance* of the loans generated by their shoppers.
- **Cash Flow Modeling**: Predicting liquidity needs based on repayment velocity.

> Note: observability does not override processor or network controls; it provides operational clarity to navigate them.

## FAQ

### Is BNPL a loan?
Legally, yes (in most jurisdictions). It is a consumer credit product.

### Who handles the chargeback?
If the consumer disputes the *goods*, the BNPL provider manages the dispute with the merchant. If the consumer disputes the *loan repayment*, the BNPL provider manages it with their own processor.

### Why is settlement risk high?
Because money goes out (to merchant) instantly, but comes back (from consumer) over 6 weeks.
