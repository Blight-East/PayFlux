# Liability Horizons in Travel and Ticketing Platforms

A liability horizon in travel and ticketing platforms is the time window between when a payment is collected and when the service is delivered. This delay creates financial exposure because disputes, refunds, and fraud can occur long before fulfillment.

## How Liability Horizons Form

Travel and ticketing platforms collect funds:

- Weeks or months before travel  
- Before inventory is consumed  
- Before customer satisfaction can be evaluated  

During this period, the platform holds funds while still being economically responsible for delivery.

## Mechanical Effects

Extended liability horizons produce:

- Processor-imposed reserves  
- Deferred revenue accounting complexity  
- High dispute risk after fulfillment failures  
- Cash flow that is illusory until completion  

A cancellation or airline failure converts future delivery risk into immediate financial loss.

## Risk Propagation

Failures propagate when:

- Vendors collapse before fulfillment  
- Border closures invalidate travel  
- Weather events trigger mass refunds  
- Fraudulent purchases mature into chargebacks  

Because exposure compounds over time, risk grows with horizon length.

## Containment Strategies

Mechanical containment includes:

- Segmenting balances by departure date  
- Applying rolling reserves based on horizon length  
- Blocking payouts until service delivery  
- Modeling cancellation risk as a financial liability  

The horizon itself is not the risk. The unmodeled exposure inside it is.
