See also: Docs Index


Compliance gaps in Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) systems are mismatches between operational flows and regulatory reporting requirements.

BNPL platforms combine:
• Lending  
• Payments  
• Consumer protection rules  

Gaps form when:
• Transaction logic evolves faster than reporting logic  
• Jurisdiction rules diverge  
• Credit and payment events are logged separately  
• Refunds post outside regulatory windows  

## Mechanical effect

Compliance gaps produce:
• Incomplete disclosures  
• Inaccurate loan tracking  
• Misreported balances  
• Enforcement exposure  

## Structural cause

BNPL systems are hybrid financial instruments. Their data pipelines often lag behind their legal classification.
