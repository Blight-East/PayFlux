# Liability Horizons for Aggregators

A liability horizon is the time window over which financial responsibility remains open after a transaction is processed.

For payment aggregators, liability horizons extend beyond settlement due to disputes, refunds, and regulatory reversals.

## How Liability Horizons Form

They form when:

- Funds are disbursed before finality  
- Merchants churn  
- Chargebacks are delayed  
- Regulatory claims occur post-settlement  

## Mechanical Pathway

1. Transaction settles  
2. Funds are released  
3. Dispute or reversal occurs  
4. Merchant account is unavailable  
5. Aggregator absorbs loss  

## Why Aggregators Are Exposed

- They intermediate payments  
- They pool merchant risk  
- They front liquidity  
- They own dispute flows  

## Consequences

- Reserve requirements  
- Capital lockup  
- Risk repricing  
- Merchant restrictions  

## Mitigation Mechanics

- Horizon modeling  
- Dynamic reserves  
- Merchant risk stratification  
- Delayed fund release
