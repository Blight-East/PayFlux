# What is Model Drift in Crypto Onramps and Exchanges?

Model drift occurs when fraud or risk models lose accuracy over time because transaction behavior evolves faster than the model adapts.

In crypto onramps, this happens as fraud tactics mutate rapidly.

## How Drift Forms

Drift forms when:

- New wallet behaviors emerge  
- Attackers adapt to detection rules  
- Legitimate user behavior changes  
- Training data becomes stale  

## Why Crypto Amplifies Drift

Crypto systems drift faster because:

- Transactions are irreversible  
- Identity signals are weak  
- Cross-border volume is high  
- Fraud patterns mutate quickly  

## System Consequences

Drift causes:

- Rising false positives  
- Missed fraud detection  
- Regulatory exposure  
- Liquidity instability
