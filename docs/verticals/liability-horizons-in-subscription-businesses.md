# What is a Liability Horizon in Subscription Businesses?

A liability horizon in subscription businesses is the time window between when revenue is recognized and when financial responsibility for disputes or refunds expires.

In subscriptions, this horizon can extend across billing cycles.

## How Liability Horizons Form

They form due to:

- Recurring billing structures  
- Deferred chargebacks  
- Trial periods converting to paid plans  
- Subscription cancellations lagging refunds  

## Why Subscriptions Have Long Horizons

Subscription models extend liability because:

- Customers may dispute multiple months at once  
- Refunds propagate after churn  
- Processors aggregate disputes over time  

## System Impact

Long liability horizons cause:

- Delayed reserve triggers  
- Inaccurate revenue forecasting  
- Risk model lag  
- Cash flow misalignment
