# What are Compliance Gaps in Adtech and Lead Generation Platforms?

Compliance gaps occur when platform behavior diverges from regulatory or processor policy requirements without immediate detection.

In adtech, this often stems from opaque traffic sources and delayed enforcement.

## How Gaps Form

They form due to:

- Indirect merchant relationships  
- Aggregated traffic sources  
- Delayed reporting  
- Fragmented policy enforcement  

## Why Adtech is Vulnerable

Adtech platforms face gaps because:

- Transactions are tied to marketing funnels  
- Merchant identity is abstracted  
- Traffic quality is hard to verify  
- Policy enforcement is retroactive  

## System Consequences

Compliance gaps lead to:

- Account suspensions  
- Fund holds  
- Regulatory review  
- Reputation loss
