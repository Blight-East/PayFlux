# Compliance Gaps in BNPL

Compliance gaps in Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) systems arise when regulatory obligations lag behind operational reality.

BNPL combines lending, payments, and credit underwriting into flows that traditional compliance regimes treat separately.

## How Gaps Form

Gaps form when:

- Lending logic is embedded in checkout  
- Risk is distributed across partners  
- Jurisdictional rules differ  
- Reporting systems are incomplete  

## Mechanical Pathway

1. Customer credit is extended  
2. Funds are settled via payment rails  
3. Regulatory classification is ambiguous  
4. Reporting fails to align  
5. Liability accumulates  

## Why BNPL Is Vulnerable

- Hybrid product structure  
- Rapid geographic expansion  
- Third-party underwriting  
- Split settlement models  

## Consequences

- Enforcement risk  
- Fines  
- Forced operational changes  
- Loss of processing privileges  

## Mitigation Mechanics

- Unified compliance modeling  
- Jurisdictional rule mapping  
- Continuous audit trails  
- Explicit liability ownership  

## FAQ

### What is a compliance gap?
A compliance gap is a mismatch between system behavior and regulatory obligations.

### Why are BNPL systems exposed?
Because they blend lending and payments in ways regulations treat separately.

### Are compliance gaps intentional?
No. They emerge from system complexity.

### Can compliance gaps be closed?
They can be narrowed through clearer modeling and reporting.
