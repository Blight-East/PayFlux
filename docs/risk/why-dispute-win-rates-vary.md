# Why Dispute Win Rates Vary

## Overview

Dispute win rates vary across time, processors, and product lines due to procedural and categorical factors.

## Primary Drivers
- Reason code distribution
- Evidence completeness
- Timing compliance
- Transaction context
- Issuer variance

## Structural Limitations

Dispute processes operate under fixed response windows, standardized schemas, and limited merchant feedback loops.

## Infrastructure Role

Systems segment disputes by category, track historical success patterns, and preserve documentation.

## Where Payflux Fits

Payflux aggregates dispute outcome data, surfaces variance drivers, and enables comparative analysis across processors. It does not modify win rates.
