# What is Settlement Timing Risk?

Settlement timing risk is the exposure created by delays between transaction authorization, capture, and fund settlement.

During this interval:

- goods or services may be delivered  
- funds may not yet be received  
- disputes or reversals may occur  

Settlement timing risk increases when:

- payout cycles are long  
- refunds or reversals are frequent  
- enforcement actions delay fund release  

## Key Mechanics

- Authorization vs capture separation  
- Payout batching  
- Clearing and funding delays  
- Dispute window overlap  

## Why Settlement Timing Risk Matters

Long settlement intervals increase exposure windows where merchants can incur losses before funds are secured.
