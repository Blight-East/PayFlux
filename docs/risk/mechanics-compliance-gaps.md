# What are Compliance Gaps?

## Definition
Compliance gaps occur when operational systems violate regulatory expectations unintentionally.

## Why it matters
They create:
- enforcement risk
- processor penalties
- retroactive liability
- audit failures

## Causes
- incomplete logging
- partial KYC
- inconsistent enforcement
- data retention failures

## Breakdown modes
- delayed detection
- regulatory escalation
- forced shutdowns

## Where observability fits
- maps control coverage
- surfaces missing enforcement
- tracks obligation fulfillment

## FAQ
### Are gaps intentional?
Rarely. They usually emerge from system growth.

### Do gaps always cause fines?
No. But they always create exposure.
