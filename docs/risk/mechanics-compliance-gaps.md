# What are Compliance Gaps?

## Definition
Compliance gaps occur when operational systems violate regulatory expectations unintentionally.

## Why it matters
They create:
- enforcement risk
- processor penalties
- retroactive liability
- audit failures

## Causes
- incomplete logging
- partial KYC
- inconsistent enforcement
- data retention failures

## Breakdown modes
- delayed detection
- regulatory escalation
- forced shutdowns

## Where observability fits
- maps control coverage
- surfaces missing enforcement
- tracks obligation fulfillment

## Upstream Causes
Compliance gaps arise from:
- delayed verification updates
- jurisdictional policy mismatches
- document review backlogs
- inconsistent merchant classification
- model retraining lag
- rule change propagation delays

These gaps form when operational timing diverges from regulatory expectations.


## Downstream Effects
Compliance gaps result in:
- account restrictions
- document re-requests
- payout suspension
- escalated manual review
- reserve imposition

They convert administrative lag into financial enforcement.


## Common Failure Chains
**Policy Change → Review Lag → Compliance Gap → Account Freeze**

**Growth Spike → Classification Drift → Compliance Trigger**

**Document Delay → Threshold Breach → Enforcement Action**

These chains explain why compliance failures appear suddenly after long quiet periods.


## FAQ
### Are gaps intentional?
Rarely. They usually emerge from system growth.

### Do gaps always cause fines?
No. But they always create exposure.
