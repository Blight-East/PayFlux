# Compliance Gaps

Compliance gaps arise when operational behavior diverges from regulatory or network requirements.

## How Gaps Form

Compliance gaps appear when:
- Monitoring is incomplete
- Rules change without propagation
- Controls are manual
- Thresholds are outdated
- Escalation paths are undefined

## Risk Impact

Gaps can trigger:
- Processor intervention
- Forced audits
- Account suspension
- Fund holds
- Contract termination

## Common Gap Areas

- Dispute ratio thresholds
- Velocity limits
- KYC refresh intervals
- Prohibited business detection
- Chargeback response timing

## Example

A merchant crosses a dispute ratio threshold without alerting. Weeks later, payouts are frozen without warning.

## Key Insight

Compliance failures are usually structural, not malicious.
