# How Risk Threshold Events Work

## Overview

Risk threshold events occur when predefined limits are crossed within a processor’s monitoring systems.

## Why This Exists

Thresholds allow automated enforcement of risk policies.

## How It Works

Systems monitor:
- Chargeback ratios
- Refund ratios
- Transaction velocity
- Exposure balances

Crossing thresholds triggers:
- Holds
- Reviews
- Restrictions
- Account state changes

## What Triggers Events

- Marketing spikes
- Product launches
- Subscription churn
- Fraud clusters

## Why Events Feel Automatic

Thresholds are enforced programmatically.

## What Support Can and Cannot Do

Support cannot change threshold rules.

## What Infrastructure Can Do

Infrastructure can:
- Surface threshold crossings
- Preserve event history
- Map contributing signals

## Where Payflux Fits

Payflux records threshold-related state changes across processors.
