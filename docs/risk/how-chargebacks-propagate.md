# How Chargebacks Propagate Through Payment Networks

## Overview

A chargeback begins with a cardholder dispute and propagates through multiple systems before reaching the merchant.

## Why This Exists

Card networks require dispute mechanisms to protect cardholders from fraud and misbilling.

## How It Works

1. Customer disputes transaction
2. Issuing bank opens case
3. Network transmits claim
4. Processor debits merchant
5. Evidence window opens
6. Outcome is adjudicated

## What Triggers Escalation

- Multiple disputes
- Similar transaction patterns
- Repeat customers
- Time-delayed fulfillment

## Why Chargebacks Lag Sales

Disputes arrive weeks after purchase. Risk systems respond to delayed loss signals.

## What Support Can and Cannot Do

Support cannot stop network processes or reverse filed disputes.

## What Infrastructure Can Do

Infrastructure can:

- Track dispute velocity
- Identify clustering
- Preserve evidence history
- Model exposure

## Where Payflux Fits

Payflux organizes dispute data across processors to allow earlier pattern recognition.
