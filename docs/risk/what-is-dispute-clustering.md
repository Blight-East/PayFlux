Dispute clustering is the grouping of chargebacks around shared attributes.

Dispute clustering occurs across time, product, geography, or user cohort.

Dispute clustering accelerates threshold activation.

Primary dispute clustering drivers:
	•	delayed customer response
	•	shared operational failures
	•	correlated merchant behavior
	•	feedback amplification

Clusters produce enforcement faster than isolated disputes.

Key Mechanics
	•	disputes occur in bursts
	•	clusters share causal attributes
	•	thresholds activate on density
	•	propagation follows cluster shape

Why Dispute Clustering Matters

Dispute Clustering converts local failures into systemic penalties.
