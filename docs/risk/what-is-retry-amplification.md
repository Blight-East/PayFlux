# What is Retry Amplification?

## Definition
Retry amplification occurs when a payment failure causes multiple follow-on attempts that multiply system exposure rather than resolving it. It is not a single retry, but the exponential growth of transaction volume caused by retries.

## Why it matters
Each retry creates a new transaction, trains risk models, affects issuer trust, and increases dispute surface area. If retries cluster in time, they resemble card testing or attack behavior, triggering upstream blocks.

## Signals to monitor
- Retry-to-success ratios  
- Retry clustering across time windows  
- Duplicate authorization attempts  
- New fraud model inputs generated by retries  
- Expanded dispute exposure  

## Breakdown modes
- Immediate client retries on failure  
- Multiple processors attempting authorization  
- SDKs retrying without visibility into failure cause  
- Schedulers replaying failed jobs  
- Infinite retry loops
