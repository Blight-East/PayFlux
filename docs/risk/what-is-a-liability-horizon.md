## Definition
A liability horizon is the time window between when a transaction is processed and when its financial or legal responsibility becomes fixed. Risk exists inside this window, which varies based on network rules, dispute windows, and regulatory timelines.

## Why it matters
Liability horizons determine when funds are truly safe, when reversals can occur, and when final compliance obligations activate. Ignoring these horizons creates false confidence and hides future costs behind current revenue.

## Signals to monitor
- Settlement delay alerts
- Dispute volume spikes
- Active risk investigations
- Pending enforcement actions
- Funding cycle shifts
- Chargeback lag metrics

## Breakdown modes
- **Latent Exposure**: Cumulative risk accumulating without being realized in current metrics.
- **False Confidence**: Treating processed funds as safe before the liability window closes.
- **Overlapping Horizons**: Multiple transactions sharing overlapping exposure windows, complicating risk assessment.
- **Retroactive Realization**: Realizing exposure only after a discrete event like a freeze or clawback.
