# What Is a Liability Horizon?

A liability horizon is the time window between when a transaction is processed and when its financial or legal responsibility becomes fixed.

Risk exists inside this window.

## How Liability Horizons Form

Liability horizons depend on:
- Settlement timing
- Dispute windows
- Reserve policies
- Regulatory timelines

During this period, exposure can grow without being realized.

## Why Liability Horizons Matter

They determine:
- When funds are truly safe
- When reversals can occur
- When compliance obligations activate

Ignoring liability horizons creates false confidence.

## What Extends Liability Horizons

Horizons lengthen when:
- Settlement is delayed
- Dispute volumes rise
- Investigations occur
- Enforcement is pending

Exposure exists until closure.

## FAQ

### Is liability horizon the same as settlement time?
No. Settlement ends money movement. Liability may persist after.

### Can liability horizons overlap?
Yes. Multiple transactions can share overlapping exposure windows.

### Are liability horizons visible?
Usually not. They must be inferred from system rules and events.

### Why are liability horizons dangerous?
They hide future costs behind current revenue.
