# Understanding Decline Reason Codes

## Overview
When a transaction is declined, the issuer provides a response code explaining why. Understanding these codes is essential for diagnosing payment health. However, codes are often generic or misleading, requiring interpretation based on context and patterns.

## Network vs issuer decline codes
- **Network Codes**: Generated by Visa/Mastercard when the transaction fails infrastructure checks (e.g., "Invalid Merchant ID").
- **Issuer Codes**: Generated by the cardholder's bank (e.g., "Insufficient Funds," "Do Not Honor").
- **Processor Codes**: Generated by the gateway risk engine (e.g., "Gateway Rejected: Fraud").

## Common decline categories
1.  **Financial**: The cardholder lacks funds or credit limit (e.g., `51 Insufficient Funds`).
2.  **Technical**: Data format errors or system outages (e.g., `91 Issuer Unavailable`).
3.  **Risk/Fraud**: The issuer suspects unauthorized use (e.g., `59 Suspected Fraud`, `05 Do Not Honor`).
4.  **Administrative**: Account closed, card expired, or PIN invalid.

## Why codes change over time
Issuer behavior is not static. A bank might change its mapping during a system update, causing `Suspected Fraud` to suddenly appear as `Do Not Honor`. Seasonal risk adjustments can also cause a specific BIN range to start declining transactions that were previously approved.

## Operational impact
- **False Positives**: Generic codes like `Do Not Honor` mask the true reason, leading to unnecessary support tickets.
- **Retry Strategy**: Financial declines can be retried; Risk declines should not be. Misinterpreting codes leads to compliance violations.
- **Merchant Confusion**: Merchants often blame the processor for declines that are actually issuer-driven.

## Where observability infrastructure fits
Infrastructure standardizes decline telemetry. It:
- **Normalizes Codes**: Mapping disparate processor codes into a unified schema.
- **Drill-down**: Breaking down "Do Not Honor" rates by issuing bank to see if it's a specific institution's policy.
- **Definition Hosting**: Providing clear, human-readable definitions for obscure raw codes.
