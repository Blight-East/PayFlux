# How Merchant Underwriting Works

## Overview

Merchant underwriting is the process of assessing business risk prior to enabling payment acceptance. Underwriting decisions determine approval, reserve requirements, and processing limits.

## Evaluation Criteria

Underwriting evaluates:
- Business model
- Product category
- Ownership structure
- Geographic exposure
- Historical processing behavior

## Risk Classification

Merchants are categorized into risk tiers which influence:
- Settlement delays
- Reserve percentages
- Processing caps
- Review frequency

## Ongoing Reviews

Underwriting is not static. Merchants may be re-evaluated based on:
- Volume changes
- Dispute ratios
- Regulatory updates
- Documentation updates

## Infrastructure Role

Underwriting systems:
- Encode classification rules
- Store merchant profiles
- Track review events
- Log decision history
