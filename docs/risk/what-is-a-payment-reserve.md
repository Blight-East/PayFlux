# What Is a Payment Reserve

## Overview

A payment reserve is a portion of merchant funds that a processor temporarily withholds to cover potential future losses such as refunds, chargebacks, or disputes.

Reserves are a capital protection mechanism used by processors to manage delayed financial risk.

They are not penalties and do not indicate wrongdoing by default.

## Why Reserves Exist

Payment systems operate with delayed loss signals:

- Customers can dispute transactions weeks later
- Refund obligations can exceed current balances
- Card networks enforce liability windows
- Banks require capital buffers

A reserve ensures funds remain available if losses occur after payouts have already been issued.

## Common Types of Reserves

### Rolling Reserve

A percentage of daily volume (e.g., 10%) is held for a fixed period (e.g., 90 days) and then released on a rolling basis.

### Fixed Reserve

A specific amount is held until risk thresholds decline or contractual terms are satisfied.

### Minimum Balance Requirement

The account must maintain a minimum available balance at all times.

Processors may combine these methods depending on risk profile.

## What Triggers a Reserve

Reserves are commonly applied when:

- Dispute ratios increase
- Volume grows rapidly
- Fulfillment is delayed
- Business model changes
- Product category shifts
- Regulatory reviews occur
- Negative balance risk rises

These triggers are evaluated automatically and through periodic underwriting review.

## Why Reserves Feel Arbitrary

From a merchant perspective, reserves appear sudden because:

- Risk signals arrive after transactions clear
- Reviews occur in scheduled cycles
- Thresholds are enforced automatically
- Decisions are driven by aggregate patterns, not individual intent

The reserve reflects historical behavior reaching a system boundary.

## Why Support Cannot Remove a Reserve

Support teams cannot change:

- Risk scoring models
- Capital formulas
- Network liability rules
- Underwriting thresholds
- Banking partner requirements

These are embedded into contractual and regulatory frameworks.

## What Risk Infrastructure Can Do

Risk infrastructure cannot remove reserves.

It can:

- Show exactly how much is reserved
- Track when funds are scheduled to release
- Identify which risk signals contributed
- Maintain audit history
- Organize supporting documentation
- Coordinate responses across processors

This enables operational clarity without attempting to bypass controls.

## Where Payflux Fits

Payflux operates as processor-agnostic risk infrastructure.

It provides:

- Unified reserve visibility
- Attribution of contributing risk factors
- Historical state tracking
- Cross-processor exposure mapping
- Structured response coordination

Payflux does not prevent reserves or alter processor policies. It provides operational intelligence to manage them.

## Boundary Statement

Payflux does not guarantee fund release, remove reserves, or override processor risk decisions. It provides context, continuity, and observability.
