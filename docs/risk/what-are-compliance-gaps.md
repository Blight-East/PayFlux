# What Are Compliance Gaps?

## Definition
Compliance gaps are mismatches between regulatory requirements and how payment systems behave in practice under load, failure, or attack. They are not intentional policy violations but operational mismatches that emerge as systems evolve.

## Why it matters
Gaps turn technical failures into regulatory and legal exposure, including penalties, forced shutdowns, processor enforcement, and retroactive liability. They expose organizations to risks that are often invisible during normal operations.

## Signals to monitor
- Retry loops bypassing controls
- Partial enforcement coverage
- Incomplete audit trails
- Latent dispute accumulation

## Breakdown modes
- Systems scaling faster than controls
- Monitoring lagging behind behavior
- Enforcement depending on batch review
- Policies assuming static conditions
