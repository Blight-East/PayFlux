# How AML Screening Works

## Overview

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) screening identifies transactions and entities associated with illicit financial activity. Screening is mandated by regulatory frameworks and enforced by banking partners.

## Screening Inputs

AML systems evaluate:
- Customer identity data
- Transaction flows
- Counterparty metadata
- Sanctions and watchlists

## Screening Layers

AML typically includes:
- Sanctions screening
- Politically exposed person (PEP) checks
- Adverse media monitoring
- Behavioral pattern analysis

## Review Process

Matches generate:
- Automated flags
- Manual compliance reviews
- Potential account restrictions

## Infrastructure Role

AML infrastructure:
- Synchronizes watchlists
- Executes screening logic
- Records screening outcomes
- Maintains regulatory audit trails

## Where Payflux Fits
