# Liability Horizons

Liability horizons define the time window during which a processed transaction carries financial risk (e.g., chargeback liability).

## What Determines a Horizon

Horizons vary based on:
- Card network rules (typically 120 days)
- Processor contracts
- Regional laws
- Delivery windows (goods vs services)

## Why It Matters

Understanding the horizon determines:
- Reserve release schedules
- Exposure calculation
- Cash flow planning
- Tail risk estimation

## Risk Dynamics

- Long horizons (e.g., event tickets, travel) store risk for months.
- Short horizons (e.g., immediate digital goods) clear risk faster.
- Refunds typically reset or extend the horizon.

## Example

A travel agency sells tickets 6 months in advance. The liability horizon is at least 6 months plus the claim window. A bankruptcy during this window triggers massive chargebacks.

## Key Insight

Cash in the bank is not profit until the liability horizon closes.
