# What is a Liability Horizon?

## Definition
A liability horizon is the period after a transaction during which reversal or dispute remains possible.

## Why it matters
It determines:
- reserve requirements
- payout delays
- accounting treatment
- capital exposure

## Examples
- Card disputes: 120–540 days
- ACH returns: up to 60 days
- BNPL defaults: months
- Fraud claims: variable

## Breakdown modes
- underfunded reserves
- premature payouts
- unexpected clawbacks

## Where observability fits
- maps exposure windows
- aligns funds to risk
- forecasts release timing

## FAQ
### Does settlement end liability?
No. Settlement only moves funds, not responsibility.

### Are horizons fixed?
No. They vary by network and product.
