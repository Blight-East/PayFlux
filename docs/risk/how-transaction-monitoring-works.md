# How Transaction Monitoring Works

## Overview

Transaction monitoring systems analyze payment activity to detect patterns associated with financial risk, fraud, or regulatory violations. These systems operate continuously and evaluate transactions against predefined behavioral models.

## Monitoring Signals

Common monitoring inputs include:
- Transaction velocity
- Geographic inconsistencies
- Product category changes
- Refund and dispute ratios
- Customer behavior patterns

## Rule-Based and Model-Based Systems

Monitoring systems typically combine:
- Rule-based thresholds
- Statistical models
- Machine learning classifiers

## Alert Generation

When thresholds are exceeded:
- Alerts are generated
- Transactions may be flagged for review
- Accounts may enter restricted states

## Infrastructure Role

Monitoring infrastructure:
- Aggregates transaction streams
- Applies detection logic
- Logs alert history
- Preserves auditability

## Where Payflux Fits

Payflux aggregates monitoring signals across processors and preserves historical alert state for operational visibility. It does not determine enforcement outcomes.
